# Exploratory Data Analysis of Diabetes Progression
##### Author: [Lisa Monozlai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisamonozlai/)

This project uses Python to examine how common clinical measures (such as BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol) relate to diabetes progression. The focus is on producing clear insights accessible to a broad audience. The project can be viewed either as a [PDF](https://github.com/lisamonozlai/exploratory-data-analysis-of-diabetes-progression/blob/main/reports/eda_diabetes_progression.pdf) or in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/lisamonozlai/exploratory-data-analysis-of-diabetes-progression/blob/main/notebooks/eda_diabetes_progression.ipynb).

## Dataset
This analysis uses a well-known 2004 diabetes dataset (`diabetes.csv`) from the [University of Copenhagen](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/%7Eboos/var.select/diabetes.html), commonly used in data science education.
The data includes clinical and demographic information for 442 individuals, with all values standardized for privacy and consistency.

## Why This Project

Understanding which health factors are most closely associated with diabetes progression helps guide further analysis and decision-making.

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can:

- Reveal meaningful patterns in real-world data
- Communicate insights clearly using visualizations
- Support informed next steps without complex models

## What I Did

- Checked data quality and distributions
- Compared progression across age and sex groups
- Visualized relationships between health indicators and progression
- Used simple trend lines to compare the strength of relationships

## Key Findings

- **Stronger associations**: body mass index (BMI) and triglycerides
- **Protective relationship**: HDL (“good”) cholesterol
- **Moderate associations**: blood pressure and blood glucose
- **Smaller effects**: age and sex

These results align with medical expectations and help highlight which factors may matter most.

## Limitations & Next Steps

Limitations of Analysis

- Examines one factor at a time
- Uses a relatively small dataset
- Does not make predictions

Next Steps

- Combine multiple factors in a single model
- Evaluate predictive performance
- Quantify uncertainty around results

## Audience

This project is intended as:

- A portfolio example demonstrating clear exploratory analysis
- A learning resource for those practicing data analysis and visualization
- A reference for communicating data insights to non-technical audiences
